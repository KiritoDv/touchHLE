# This file contains touchHLE's recommended default options for various apps.
#
# *** Don't edit this file yourself! Use touchHLE_options.txt instead. ***

#
# Each line in this file specifies options for an app; there should only be one
# line per app. A line should consist of the identifier for an app, followed by
# a colon (:), followed by the options to apply. To find out an app's
# identifier, you can run it in touchHLE and look at the “App bundle info”
# output. To get a list of possible options, see OPTIONS_HELP.txt or run
# touchHLE with the --help flag.
#
# Text on a line following a hash sign (#) is treated as a comment and ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Guidelines for default options:
# - Even if an app supports auto-rotation, it's good to specify the required
#   orientation anyway, so that it doesn't display in the wrong orientation for
#   a few seconds during startup.
# - The scale hack is not exactly faithful to the original experience, and there
#   is no scale factor that works for everyone, so it shouldn't be used here.
